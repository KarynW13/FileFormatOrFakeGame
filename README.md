# FileFormatOrFakeGame
Code created to run a game that aims to teach users about file formats and the PRONOM File Format Registry
The code is written using JavaScript and displayed using HTMl and CSS. 
The game has questions and a timer set at 30 seconds toanswer each question. The player is shown if they are right or wrong after each question and given a total score at the end
Further design is required for the game to be used publicly. I'll come back to this.
